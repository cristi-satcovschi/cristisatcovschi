- use the custom node version

actual version
Actual: {"npm":"9.6.3","node":"v19.9.0"}

expensify version:
Required: {"node":"16.15.1","npm":"8.11.0"}

run `nvm install`

======
Your userâ€™s .npmrc file (${HOME}/.npmrc)
has a `globalconfig` and/or a `prefix` setting, which are incompatible with nvm.
Run `nvm use --delete-prefix v16.15.1` to unset it.
